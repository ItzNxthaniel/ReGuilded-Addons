# ReGuilded Addon Tutorial
I use a settings.json in my addons to handle client settings.

### The Download:
- Custom Sounds (id: customSounds) [[Click Here](https://downgit.github.io/#/home?url=https://github.com/ItzNxthaniel/ReGuilded-Addons/tree/main/addons/CustomSounds)]
    - Customize your sounds you hear on Guilded. Just put a source file into the `settings.json`, relating to the sound you want to customize!
    
### The Installation:
Unzip the folder, and follow the steps [here](https://github.com/ReGuilded/ReGuilded-Themes/wiki/User-Settings) to get to User Settings.
Place the unzipped folder into the `addons` directory in your user settings.

To enable the addon, head into your User Settings in app, go to "addons" and flick the toggle switch for the addon you want!
